## Delegation

### Decentralized Authorization and Security

- **A Comprehensive Approach to User Delegation and Anonymity within Decentralized Identifiers for IoT** – Addresses challenges in authority delegation and anonymity in IoT environments, proposing a scheme that enhances data sovereignty and security. [PDF](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11014293/pdf/sensors-24-02215.pdf)
- **Authenticated Delegation and Authorized AI Agents** – Introduces a framework for authenticated, authorized, and auditable delegation to AI agents, enabling secure task delegation while maintaining accountability. [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09674)
- **DAMFSD: A Decentralized Authorization Model with Flexible and Secure Delegation** – Proposes a model that enhances security in decentralized systems by allowing flexible delegation of authority while ensuring robust access control mechanisms. [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542660524002580)
- **Delegating Authentication to Edge: A Decentralized Authentication Architecture for Vehicular Networks** – Presents an architecture that delegates authentication tasks to edge nodes, improving scalability and security in vehicular networks. [Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9205261)
- **Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP)** – An in-progress effort by the IETF to develop a next-generation authorization protocol, enabling fine-grained delegation for API access and identity assertions. [Link](https://oauth.net/gnap/)
- **Independently Verifiable Decentralized Role-Based Delegation** – Introduces a mechanism where credentials can be verified without relying on domain administrators, supporting efficient cross-domain delegation of authority. [PDF](https://people.cs.vt.edu/danfeng/papers/rbcdPaper.pdf)

### Distributed Systems and Event-Driven Architectures

- **A Distributed State of Mind: Event-Driven Multi-Agent Systems** – Discusses how event-driven architectures in multi-agent systems can leverage delegation and decentralized control to enhance responsiveness and scalability. [Link](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3808083/a-distributed-state-of-mind-event-driven-multi-agent-systems.html/amp/)

### Functional Encryption and Delegation

- **Delegation in Functional Encryption** – Explores mechanisms for delegating decryption capabilities within functional encryption schemes, balancing flexibility and security in access control. [Link](https://hal.science/tel-02394349/document?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Human-Agent Delegation and Cooperation

- **Delegation to Autonomous Agents Promotes Cooperation** – Examines how human behavior changes when decisions are delegated to AI agents in social dilemmas. Experiments reveal that groups allowing autonomous delegation exhibit higher cooperation, though mixed human–AI groups show reduced benefits. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07710#:~:text=understand%20experimentally%20whether%20the%20presence,less%20to%20the%20collective%20effort)

### Mechanism Design and Efficiency in Delegation

- **Delegated Pandora’s Box** – Studies costly search problems in delegation, defining the “delegation gap” as the efficiency loss when principals delegate search tasks. It identifies conditions under which this gap can be capped by a constant factor. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10382#:~:text=such%20problems%20and%20space%20of,binary)
- **Delegated Search Approximates Efficient Search** – Presents a theoretical model where a principal delegates a search task to an agent with misaligned incentives. The mechanism guarantees outcomes within a constant factor of the optimal solution and reveals links to prophet inequalities in optimal stopping theory. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06933#:~:text=,mechanisms%20with%20a%20natural%20threshold)
- **On the Theory of Delegation** – A foundational work that introduces a formal framework for understanding how principals optimally delegate tasks to agents under asymmetric information conditions.

### Multi-Agent Systems and Task Delegation Frameworks

- **A Model of Delegation for Multi-Agent Systems** – Proposes a formal logical framework for one agent to delegate tasks to another via communicative acts, clarifying how obligations and accountability are transferred. [PDF](http://arg.tech/people/chris/publications/2002/ukmas-book.pdf#:~:text=Abstract,latter%20commitments%20might%20then%20be)
- **Multi-Agent Goal Delegation** – Introduces an approach for collaborative goal achievement where agents use goal reasoning and a theory-of-mind model to decide which goals to pursue or delegate, enhancing overall team performance. [Link](https://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10352576)
- **Normative Multi-Agent Task Delegation Framework** – Describes a practical framework using autonomous agents and normative rules to handle task overload in organizations, validated through simulation to show improved on-time task completion. [Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289421284_A_normative_multi-agent_framework_for_dynamic_task_assignment_and_delegation#:~:text=The%20problem%20of%20task%20overload,We%20simulate%20the)
- **Too Many Cooks: Coordinating Multi-Agent Collaboration Through Inverse Planning** – Introduces Bayesian Delegation, a decentralized learning mechanism that uses inverse planning for agents to infer others’ intentions, thereby facilitating flexible coordination in collaborative tasks. [PDF](https://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/cogsci20/papers/0157/0157.pdf)
