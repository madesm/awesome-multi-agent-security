## Delegation

### Mechanism Design and Efficiency in Delegation

- **Delegated Search Approximates Efficient Search (Kleinberg & Kleinberg, 2018)** – Presents a theoretical model of delegation where a principal delegates a search task to an agent with misaligned incentives. The authors design a mechanism that guarantees the principal’s outcome is within a constant factor of the optimal (as if searching themselves), using simple threshold policies ([[1806.06933] Delegated Search Approximates Efficient Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06933#:~:text=,mechanisms%20with%20a%20natural%20threshold)). Notably, their solution reveals an unexpected link between optimal delegation strategies and prophet inequalities from optimal stopping theory ([[1806.06933] Delegated Search Approximates Efficient Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06933#:~:text=structure%2C%20which%20are%20thus%20structurally,on%20the%20behavior%20of%20our)).
- **Delegating to Multiple Agents (Hajiaghayi *et al*., 2023)** – Extends the delegation model to multiple agents without monetary transfers. It shows that competition among agents enables prior-independent mechanisms that improve both information *and* performance for the principal ([Delegating to Multiple Agents](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2305.03203.html#:~:text=on%20the%20agents%27%20signals,independent)). Notably, having at least two agents yields strictly higher utility for the principal than a single-agent scenario, illustrating the benefit of multi-agent delegation ([Delegating to Multiple Agents](https://ideas.repec.org/p/arx/papers/2305.03203.html#:~:text=mechanisms%20in%20complete%2Fincomplete%20information%20settings,We%20further)).

- **Delegated Pandora’s Box (Bechtel *et al*., 2022)** – Studies delegation in costly search problems (a generalized Pandora’s Box scenario) where the principal can’t search directly. It defines the “delegation gap” as the efficiency loss due to delegation ([[2202.10382] Delegated Pandora's box](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10382#:~:text=such%20problems%20and%20space%20of,binary)) and finds that a constant-factor bound on this gap exists only under restrictive conditions (e.g. all options have binary outcomes) ([[2202.10382] Delegated Pandora's box](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10382#:~:text=show%20that%20there%20is%20a,this%20impossibility%2C%20we%20consider%20two)). By altering the model – allowing free search for the agent or discounting search costs – and even sharing costs between principal and agent, the authors identify scenarios where the delegation gap can be capped by a constant factor ([[2202.10382] Delegated Pandora's box](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10382#:~:text=variants%3A%20the%20free,factor)).
- **Regret Analysis of Repeated Delegated Choice (Hajiaghayi *et al*., 2024)** – Brings the delegation problem into an online learning context with repeated interactions. Here, a principal learns to set screening rules (eligible solution sets) over time to counter a strategic agent without prior distribution knowledge. The study provides algorithms with sublinear regret (and matching lower bounds) for various cases, demonstrating that effective learning can mitigate delegation inefficiency over time ([Regret Analysis of Repeated Delegated Choice](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/28834/29589#:~:text=solutions%20yield%20deterministic%20or%20stochastic,comprehensive%20study%20in%20this%20problem)).

### Multi-Agent Systems and Task Delegation Frameworks

- **A Model of Delegation for Multi-Agent Systems (Norman & Reed, 2002)** – Proposes a formal logical framework for one agent to delegate tasks to another through communicative acts. It introduces semantic definitions for imperative commands and distinguishes different types of responsibility when tasks are delegated ([UKMASBook2002.dvi](http://arg.tech/people/chris/publications/2002/ukmas-book.pdf#:~:text=Abstract,latter%20commitments%20might%20then%20be)) ([UKMASBook2002.dvi](http://arg.tech/people/chris/publications/2002/ukmas-book.pdf#:~:text=car%02ried%20out%20or%20state%20achieved,then%20be%20applied%20in%20specifying)). This work lays a foundation for understanding delegation in agent communication languages, clarifying how obligations and accountability transfer between agents.
- **Normative Multi-Agent Task Delegation Framework (Itaiwi *et al*., 2013)** – Describes a practical framework that uses autonomous agents and normative rules to handle task overload in organizations. Agents can dynamically reassign or delegate tasks under prescribed norms to ensure deadlines are met even when some members are overloaded ([A normative multi-agent framework for dynamic task assignment and delegation | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289421284_A_normative_multi-agent_framework_for_dynamic_task_assignment_and_delegation#:~:text=The%20problem%20of%20task%20overload,We%20simulate%20the)). The approach was validated via simulation in an academic workflow scenario, showing improved on-time task completion by incorporating delegation policies.
- **Multi-Agent Goal Delegation (Gogineni *et al*., 2021)** – Introduces an approach for collaborative goal achievement in a team of agents by intelligent delegation of goals. Each agent uses goal reasoning to decide which goals to pursue versus delegate, and employs a theory-of-mind model to choose appropriate teammates for those delegated goals and to share necessary knowledge ([](https://sravya-kondrakunta.github.io/9thGoal-Reasoning-Workshop/papers/Paper_6.pdf#:~:text=This%20paper%20addresses%20the%20limitations,agent%20system%20that%20randomly)). In experiments (e.g. a marine survey domain), this method outperformed naive random delegation by better leveraging agents’ complementary capabilities and knowledge sharing.

### Human-Agent Delegation and Cooperation
- **Delegation to Autonomous Agents Promotes Cooperation (Fernández Domingos *et al*., 2021)** – Examines how human behavior changes when people can delegate decisions to AI agents in a social dilemma (a public-goods game with risk). In controlled experiments, groups that allowed members to hand off decisions to autonomous agents saw higher overall cooperation rates ([[2103.07710] Delegation to autonomous agents promotes cooperation in collective-risk dilemmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07710#:~:text=understand%20experimentally%20whether%20the%20presence,less%20to%20the%20collective%20effort)). However, when human and AI decision-makers mixed, the benefit was reduced, and humans displayed a bias by expecting AI agents to contribute less than humans in the group ([[2103.07710] Delegation to autonomous agents promotes cooperation in collective-risk dilemmas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07710#:~:text=such%20a%20dilemma,less%20to%20the%20collective%20effort)).
